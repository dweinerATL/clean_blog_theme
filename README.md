# Clean Blog Theme

This theme was manually forked from [drupal/d8_blog_theme](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/d8_blog_theme) to provide Drupal 11 support and allow it to be used as a base theme for customization.

Currently, no changes have been made beyond adding Drupal 11 compatibility, allowing sub-theming and removing support for Drupal 8.
